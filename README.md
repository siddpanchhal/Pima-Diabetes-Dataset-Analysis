# Pima-Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis

DATA ANALYSIS AND EDA 

- Objective: Analyzed the Pima Diabetes dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to diabetes.

- Data Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the
dataset for analysis.

- Hypothesis Testing: Performed statistical tests to validate assumptions about the relationships between variables and
their impact on diabetes.

- Validation Tests: Applied various validation techniques to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model outcomes.

-Visualization: Created comprehensive visualizations, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to explore data
distributions and correlations among features.

- Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook.
